# Getting Started with CircleCI

Fork the project

Register in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) with your GitHub credentials

Set up the projects

Then read the [CircleCI docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.
0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) to set two 
environment variables:

DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD 

For security reason [create a TOKEN](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)
instead of inserting your actual password.
